# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook designed to investigate and uncover key insights from a dataset. The analysis involves a thorough examination of the dataset to understand its structure, detect patterns, and identify important statistical relationships.

# Project Overview
The objectives of this project include:
Performing data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Conducting exploratory analysis to understand variable distributions, relationships, and trends.
Visualizing data through charts and graphs to illustrate key insights effectively.

# Notebook Contents
The main notebook file, Exploratory Data analysis.ipynb, covers:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Removing missing values, handling duplicates, and transforming data as needed.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculating summary statistics to understand data distributions.
Data Visualization: Creating charts and graphs (such as histograms, bar charts, scatter plots) to identify patterns and correlations.
Insights and Observations: Highlighting key findings from the analysis.

# Requirements
To run the notebook, youâ€™ll need:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)

# Usage
Open Exploratory Data analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis steps.
